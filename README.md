# Overview

Most people use apps on a daily basis. I wanted to dive into finding out how to make an actual app. I wanted to know how to make an app look good, but also give it functionality. I didn't know if it was easy or difficult, but I just wanted to know.
This app is a random number app. A user touches a button that increments by one according to the number of times it's been touched. The screen also has a button labeled "random" that can be touched to generate and display a random number on a second screen.
My purpose for creating this app was to gain exposure to Android Studio and learn what it takes to create a very simple app.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walk through of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio for developing this app. Since I do not have an android phone I used the emulator provided in Android Studio.
I used Kotlin for programming this random number app. The app used the java random library for generating a random number.

# Future Work
* I need to better understand the difference between an activity and a fragment.
* I want to work on understanding changing things in the strings.xml file, colors.xml file, and how each file interacts with the main xml file.
* I want to make another app to practice more and become better at creating apps.
